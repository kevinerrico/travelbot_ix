#TravelBot CapeTown

Twitter bot that scrapes data from Google Flights in order to find the cheapest deals for users in Cape Town.
The project aims to show data cleaning, data analysis and data scraping capabilities using R and the packages that gives us this whole functionality.
Also, we have hosted the code in a AWS server that runs once every hour.
If you have any comments or suggestions regarding this project, fork it and send us a pull request, we would love to extend it.
